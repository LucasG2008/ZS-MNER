# Multilingual NER with Zero-Shot Transfer Learning

This project aims to develop a parameter-efficient machine learning model for multilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) using zero-shot transfer learning.

## Overview

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for identifying entities such as names, dates, and locations in text. This project focuses on training a model on a few languages and transferring its knowledge to perform NER on many more languages without additional training.
